# Multi-step-Automated-Generation-of-Parameter-Docstrings-in-Python-An-Exploratory-Study

The project aims to achieve significant improvements in BLEU-4 and METEOR scores over existing generative models by engineering a cutting-edge framework to fine-tune PLMs using 111k Python functions for generating comprehensive docstrings. The developed framework produces meticulously formatted docstrings encompassing data types, descriptions, etc. Score-based and human-centered evaluations with 17 developers demonstrated the frameworkâ€™s superiority in enhancing documentation quality. Pre-trained models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, UniXcoder were fine-tuned to achieve extensive descriptions while task-specific models were fit into the pipeline to include derivatives derived from taxonomies for developing detailed parameter docstrings.
